# IPA-trap-game

This is a repository for trying to work out how to write a study game using the IPA with HTML5.

The original game was created by Nathan Sanders, and can be found on [flippity](https://www.flippity.net/ma.php?k=1GhEW6tBof3-7bc3CuKejU3zCo-XTBLF40IY6F2F8YNg), but unfortunately has no interactive functionality or automated generation.

My goal with the current repository is to create a more user-friendly version of the IPA trap game.
